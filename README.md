- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Thorbjorns 
- Iâ€™m completly fresh in a programming world. I want to show how do I learn coding with these small projects.
- Everything what I learn is mostly by coding, a lot from books and a little bit from web courses. 
- In this moment I'm learning spring with hibernate to make some projects using databases.

- I think I am on a good way to be a part of this intresting business.

- You can reach me by e-mail valdyrhjord@gmail.com
